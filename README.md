# Email_Mail_Detection
Email Spam Detection with Machine Learning

This project aims to build an effective email spam detection system using machine learning. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms, we aim to distinguish between legitimate ("ham") and spam ("spam") emails.

Project Overview
In today's digital age, spam emails can overwhelm our inboxes and pose significant risks, including phishing attempts and scams. This project focuses on detecting spam emails using machine learning techniques, making email communication safer and more efficient. Key steps in this project include:

Data Preprocessing: Clean and transform the dataset for machine learning.
Feature Engineering: Extract meaningful features from email data for better prediction.
Model Building: Train multiple machine learning models to detect spam.
Evaluation: Assess model performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Deployment: Implement the spam detection system for real-world use.
Problem Statement
Spam emails are unsolicited, often malicious, messages that flood inboxes, making it difficult to identify legitimate emails. This project aims to develop an email spam detection system using machine learning techniques, reducing the risks posed by spam emails.

Objectives
Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the dataset, including handling missing values, and transforming the text into a machine-readable format.
Email Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features such as the subject, sender, and content of emails.
Machine Learning Model: Train and evaluate multiple machine learning algorithms, including decision trees, support vector machines, and Naive Bayes.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using various metrics, focusing on recall for spam detection.
Deployment: Implement the model to be used in real-time email spam detection.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of a collection of emails, classified as either "ham" (legitimate) or "spam." The dataset includes columns such as:

v1: Label (ham/spam)
v2: Email text
Dataset Statistics
Total emails: 5572
Spam emails: 747
Ham emails: 4825
The data undergoes preprocessing to remove irrelevant columns and handle missing values.

Installation
To run this project, you'll need to set up your environment with the following dependencies:

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook (or Google Colab)
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, wordcloud, etc.

Usage
Load the dataset:

The dataset is loaded from a CSV file, and basic data exploration is performed.
Train the model:

A machine learning pipeline is used to train a Multinomial Naive Bayes model.
python
Copy
clf = Pipeline([
    ('vectorizer', CountVectorizer()),
    ('nb', MultinomialNB())
])
Make Predictions:

To classify new emails as spam or ham, use the detect_spam function:
python
Copy
result = detect_spam("Sample email text")
print(result)  # Output: "This is a Ham Email!" or "This is a Spam Email!"
Evaluation
The performance of the spam detection model is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

Key results:

Recall (Test set): 98.49%
Test Accuracy: 98.71%
ROC AUC: 0.96
